From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


In probability theory, a branching random walk is a stochastic process that generalizes both the concept of a random walk and of a branching process. At every generation (a point of discrete time), a branching random walk's value is a set of elements that are located in some linear space, such as the real line. Each element of a given generation can have several descendants in the next generation. The location of any descendant is the sum of its parent's location and a random variable.



This project was full developed with Salim Amoukou (the code is forked from his github repo)
you will find :
  - Study of branching random walk
  - Introduce new variant for biology
  - Simulation of theoretical result in C++
